# Private - Events

> We want to build a site similar to a private [Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/) which allows users to create events and then manage user signups. Users can create events and send invitations. Events take place at a specific date and at a location (which you can just store as a string, like “Andy’s House”).
> A user can create events. A user can attend many events. An event can be attended by many users.


## Usage 

- Clone the repo: $ git clone
- Run `bundle install`  in your terminal to install the Ruby gems.
- Run `rails webpacker:install` or `npm install` to install webpacker
- Run `rails db:create` to create DB before migration
- Run `rails db:migrate`  in your terminal to migrate to db databases.
- Run `$ rails server` to start your local host.
- In your terminal go to (http://127.0.0.1:3000/) 
- Sign up for a session and start a new event and attended other events!
